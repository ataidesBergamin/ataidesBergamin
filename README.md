<h2> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me </h2>

- 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp; I started to like programming at the age of 17, when I was taking an electronics technician course and had my first contact with programming logic, right away I felt that this was what I wanted, because what was difficult for others was easy for me. However, life followed other paths for me and I ended up moving away from programming, only a few years later I had the opportunity to return to programming. Now I feel ready and prepared to code a lot of code.
- 💼 &nbsp; I am currently looking for my first job as a developer and continue to specify myself and improve my knowledge with new technologies. The main technologies I am aware of are HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- 💵 &nbsp; I also really like investments, the financial market and economics.
